# Multithreaded Train Track
This program utilises concurrent programming, threads and semaphores. 20 trains arrive on a figure-eight track (10 to each side), and travel the full track while avoiding collision scenarios.

**Please Note: This code is OLD (2019/2020) and I have learned a lot since writing it.**
